                <p>Alcoholism (‘alcohol use disorder’ (AUD)) is the inability to manage one’s drinking habits. It is the most acute form of alcohol abuse. If left untreated,  alcohol abuse can quickly spiral out of control.
                <br/> <br/> Alcoholism is a disease, and consistent alcohol abuse over time can negatively impact career goals, personal relationships, and responsibilities, not to mention your physical health.
