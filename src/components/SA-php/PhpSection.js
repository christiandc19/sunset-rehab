              A partial hospitalization program (PHP) offers a hybridized
              approach to addiction treatment by combining elements of inpatient
              and outpatient programs. PHP patients donâ€™t live at the treatment
              facility like they would during residential treatment, but they do
              make regular on-site appearances throughout the week.
              <br /> <br />
              We, at Sacramento requires PHP patients to attend therapeutic
              group sessions five times a week. These sessions teach vital
              coping skills and healthy ways to communicate and manage emotions.{" "}
              <br /> <br />
              Other aspects of PHP treatment include weekly check-ins with a
              licensed psychiatrist and 24/7 on-call support. All of these serve
              to provide the necessary support someone needs to have the
              smoothest, most successful recovery possible. <br />
              <br /> PHP can be a smart choice for recovery. This substance
              abuse treatment in California serves as a middle ground between
              inpatient hospitalization and outpatient programs. In some cases,
              it can be a step down from a residential inpatient program. For
              others with severe addiction histories or other serious medical
              issues, a partial hospitalization can serve as a good starting
              point.

          <h1>BENEFITS OF OUTPATIENT TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE</h1>
          <br /> <br />
          <p>
            For people with mild to moderate symptoms, strong support systems at
            home, and the ability to function independently, outpatient
            treatment is usually an ideal choice. Patients can:
            <br /> <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Stay connected with loved ones while still receiving the
                treatment they need
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Maintain commitments and responsibilities with work and school
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Apply the skills and strategies they learn in treatment to real
                life situations
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Stay connected with their treatment team and remain accountable
                to their personalized care plan
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Transition slowly back into everyday situations, equipped with
                tools to help optimize their independence and live a meaningful
                life
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                Stay connected with loved ones while still receiving the
                treatment they need
              </li>
              <br />
            </ul>
            Most outpatient treatment programs also have the added benefit of
            being less expensive than residential programs.
